# Build Web Server from Scratch: for education

We will build this webserver in multiple language.
This is only for education purpose, feature by feature.

We will approach separately, so, each subdirectory may contain its own subject,
not necessarily depending each other.  Each subdir will be independent webserver.

Directory Structure:

ROOT (this directory)
  - subdir1 (Let's say, basic http request/response on static file)
    - python
	- cpp
	- ..will add more...
